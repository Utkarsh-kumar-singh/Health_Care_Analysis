# Health Care Analysis

Health Care Data Analysis involves the application of data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to healthcare datasets in order to gain insights, make predictions, and inform decision-making in the field of healthcare. In the context of the provided dataset, the focus was on analyzing the relationship between various independent variables and the dependent variable of patient mortality (death_yn_n).

## Appendix A: Dataset Description
The dataset used in this Health Care Data Analysis project contains information related to healthcare records. It includes the following columns:

age: Age of the patients.
sex_n: Encoded value representing the gender of the patients.
current_status_n: Encoded value indicating the current health status of the patients.
hosp_yn_n: Encoded value indicating whether the patients were admitted to the hospital or not.
icu_yn_n: Encoded value indicating whether the patients were admitted to the ICU or not.
medcond_yn_n: Encoded value indicating whether the patients had any pre-existing medical conditions.
death_yn_n: Encoded value indicating whether the patients experienced death or not.
## Appendix B: Data Preprocessing
Before conducting the analysis, the dataset underwent certain preprocessing steps. These steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing data cleaning to ensure the quality and consistency of the data.

## Appendix C: Data Analysis Techniques
Various data analysis techniques were employed to explore and analyze the dataset. These techniques included descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and machine learning algorithms. The primary objective was to understand the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable, as well as to develop predictive models for patient mortality.

## Appendix D: Model Evaluation Metrics
To assess the performance of the predictive models, accuracy was used as the primary evaluation metric. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. However, it is important to note that additional evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, or F1-score, could provide more comprehensive insights into the model's performance.

## Appendix E: Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on the analysis conducted, it was concluded that the developed models showed promise in predicting patient mortality using the selected independent variables. However, further analysis, validation, and consideration of additional factors were recommended to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the models. It was also suggested to explore other evaluation metrics and perform further research to gain deeper insights into the relationships between the variables.

## Conclsion

Based on the analysis conducted on the health care dataset, the following conclusions can be made:

The dataset consists of several independent variables, namely age, sex_n, current_status_n, hosp_yn_n, icu_yn_n, and medcond_yn_n. These variables represent important factors that can potentially influence the dependent variable, death_yn_n, which indicates whether a patient has experienced death or not.

By applying a machine learning model to the dataset, specifically using the selected independent variables, an accuracy of 78.78% was achieved in predicting the death_yn_n variable. The accuracy score represents the percentage of correct predictions made by the model based on the provided dataset.

This accuracy score indicates that the model has a reasonably good performance in predicting whether a patient will experience death based on the available independent variables. However, it is essential to interpret these results cautiously and consider other evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, or F1-score, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

It is worth noting that the accuracy achieved is specific to the given dataset and the chosen independent variables. Further analysis and evaluation, including feature engineering, model tuning, and cross-validation, may be necessary to improve the model's accuracy and ensure its robustness.

## Features

The features of the above code that can be mentioned in the Readme.md file on GitHub are as follows:

Model Evaluation: The code provides a class, ModelEvaluator, which allows for the evaluation of multiple classification models.

Supported Models: The code supports three classification models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

Performance Metrics: The code calculates various performance metrics for each model, including Accuracy Score, Precision Score, Recall Score, and F1 Score.

Multiclass Handling: The code addresses the issue of multiclass classification by setting the average parameter to 'macro' for precision, recall, and F1 score calculations.

Exception Handling: The code implements exception handling to catch any errors that may occur during model evaluation.

Input Data: The code requires the input data to be split into training and testing sets (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test).

Output: The code prints the performance metrics for each model, allowing for easy interpretation and comparison of model results.

These features demonstrate the capability of the code to evaluate multiple classification models and provide performance metrics for decision-making in health care data analysis.
